                <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li>Secured by Saint Michael the Archangel’s Sword of Bravery and Victory, nourished by the faithful acceptance and practice of the Christian teachings and guidance of the Catholic church, animated by MARY’s maternal devotion and intercession, guided by the gospel values, empowered by Christ’s life and examples - the Michaelinians of today and tomorrow are persons who are: </li><br>
                    <li><b>S</b> – ocially Responsible for the respect, care, love and development of God’s creations as such at all times demonstrate and live-out their social responsibilities;</li><br>
                    <li><b>M</b> – issionaries of Christian Values, possessing a faith that is dynamic to imbibe and to proclaim and promote the Christian values, hence, sharing in the mission of Christ and of the Catholic church to make all people members of one sheepfold of God;</li><br>
                    <li><b>C</b> – ommitted Indivuduals and/or Leaders, likened to the faithful commitment of Jesus to His Father, thus, upholding unconditional commitment to value-filled life and actions of love and mercy;</li><br>

                    <li>Therefore, Michaelinians have the identities of Social Responsibility, Missionaries of Christian Values, Committed Individuals and/or Leaders, and Competent in their Chosen Field of Endeavors, which are paramount to transform people to be person-oriented, persons of values, persons of faith and love for God, and persons of love and mercy for others.</li>

                <hr>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1948, Nasipit was still a part of the parish of Buenavista, whose parish priest was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry of Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr Martin and his co-adjutor Fr. Atanacio de Castro saw the need of putting up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was placed in charge of the school.<br><br>

                    It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the first director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Geraldo Blewanus, Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr. Venancio Portillo, Rev. Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, and Rev. Fr. Anthony Krol in that order of succession. Rev. Fr. Krol was the last Dutch priest who served as the school director.<br><br>
                    
                    The school site is beside the rectory with an area of 1,630 square metres (17,500 sq ft). Fr. Gerard Cruijen, one of the subsequent directors, converted the nipa- wooden structure into a two-storey building with 16 classrooms.<br><br>
